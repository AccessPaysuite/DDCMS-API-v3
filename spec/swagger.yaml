    Our Collection Services are based around our Eazy Customer Manager™
    application

    which manages the Direct Debit process from beginning to end and is
    connected to a

    robust and powerful BACS submission engine. The system also provides a range
    of

    management information via the easy to use secure web interface.


    ## API Technical Details


    The API is REST based and communication is conducted over a regular

    HTTPS connection. It accepts input in the `x-www-form-urlencoded` format

    with output being provided in either JSON or XML format as required.


    The output is selected using the `Accept` header including either

    `application/json` or `application/xml`. The API key should be also be

    specified in the request using the `apiKey` header.


    Our API uses four different HTTP methods to indicate the different

    operations being undertaken on the data being manipulated. These are:


    |**Method**      | **Operation**

    | -------------- | --------------

    | **HTTP GET**   | Request for information from the server. The server will
    respond with the data requested.

    | **HTTP POST**  | Request to create a record on the server. The POST
    request must be accompanied by the relevant data in the body or query string
    as dictated by the specification below.

    | **HTTP PATCH** | Request to amend (or partially amend) the record on the
    server.

    | **HTTP DELETE**| A request to remove a record from the server (only
    available on the client return data endpoint call).


    ### Example Headers for JSON Mode:


    ```

    GET
    https://ecm3.eazycollect.co.uk/api/v3/client/LUISCT/BACS/customer/callback


    Accept: application/json

    apiKey: xAQdXTPtZPG3QqsUJw73wx1o

    Content-Type: application/json

    ```


    ## The Direct Debit Process


    Throughout the development of our API we have sought to simplify the

    Direct Debit process as much as possible, however due to the technical

    nature of Direct Debits it is helpful to understand the general data

    flow and the reasons for certain time delays.


    1. After creating a ‘Customer’ record on our system, you will need to

    assign a ‘schedule’ to them. The schedule can take a number of forms:
        - A schedule that can collect ad-hoc payments as and when you
          request them via the API. There will usually be date
          restrictions in place.
        - A schedule where you ask us to collect regular amounts on
          regular dates in a month, or days in a week as per your requirements.
        - A schedule where a pre-determined amount is taken on regular
          dates in a month, or days in a week as per your instructions.
        - A schedule where the collection amounts and or dates are fixed.

        Access Paysuite creates the schedules as part of the set-up process and
        the available schedules can be listed by using the ‘schedules’ call.

    2. As soon as a schedule is applied to a customer record, we send an

    instruction to BACS to create the Direct Debit instruction. The date

    for the first payment required should be set <u>at least</u> 10 working

    days after the schedule creation date.


    3. Ad-hoc payments need to be lodged onto the *Eazy Customer Manager™*

    <u>at least</u> 5 working days before the collection date.


    4. Around three working days before the collection date, we submit the

    payments to BACS for collection. Payments cannot be changed after

    submission has occurred.


    5. The final status of the payment records can be enquired upon 3

    working days following the collection date. Where a payment

    collection date falls on a weekend or a non UK banking day, the

    collection date is automatically moved to the next working day, and

    the developer will need to take this into account. (e.g.: A payment

    scheduled on Saturday, 1st June 2013 will be collected on Monday

    3rd June 2013. Payment statuses will be available from Thursday

    6th June 2013.)


    ## A note on Working Days


    We ask that our clients allow an **absolute minimum** of 10 working days

    between creating a customer and contract and collecting the first

    payment. Payments for existing contracts must be submitted and confirmed

    by 8pm 5 working days before the collection date for existing customers

    with an active Direct Debit.


    We <u>strongly recommend</u> that customers are created and payments
    uploaded

    <u>1 -2 days in advance</u> of these cut off times as these deadlines leave

    **no** contingency to problem solve any issues that arise which could

    lead to payments being missed.


    **It is important to note** that if a collection date falls on a weekend

    or a bank holiday, then the 10 and 5 working day rules start from the

    previous working day; so for a Saturday or a Sunday, 5/10 working days

    should be counted back from the previous Friday.


    **For example:**


    <u>For payments due on Saturday 15/04/2017</u>

    - Payments for existing customers would need to be submitted and
      confirmed by 8pm on Thursday 06/04/2017.
    - New customers would need to be confirmed by 9pm on Thursday 30/03/2017.


    **Note:** 14/04/2017 was Good Friday, a Bank Holiday in the UK and does

    not count as a banking day.


    ## Using the API and UI together


    Eazy Customer Manager provides a useful User Interface (UI) available

    via your browser which gives access to your customer data and a suite of

    reports.


    If you have chosen to do a “full integration” with your own Customer

    Relationship Management or Accounting software, then it must be borne in

    mind that your software is driving the payment process entirely. In

    “full integration” mode you will be using the API to set up direct

    debits and send ad-hoc payments as and when collections are required; in

    this arrangement we generally advise against using the UI other than to

    download paid/unpaid reports.


    It is important to note that when using the API in a “full integration”

    the following anomalies will be present within the UI:


    - The account and arrears balances shown in the Access Paysuite UI
      against each customer will not reflect manual payments made in your
      CRM/Accounts package unless they are also (double) keyed as manual
      payments onto the Eazy Customer Manager UI.

    - At present, there is no way to automatically “represent” failed
      payments using the API and therefore our recommendation is to add a
      new ad-hoc payment to collect any arrears. As these are new and
      separate transactions, these will increase the total contract
      balance, but will not affect the arrears balance which will remain
      unless they are manually cleared via the UI.

    - As a result of the above, the arrears report provided within the UI
      will be incorrect and should not be relied upon. Arrears and
      contracts balances should be drawn from your own software unless you
      have keyed any manual payments and written off unpaid transactions
      that have been represented via the UI.

    If you require any further assistance with using the API and UI

    together, please contact the IT Helpdesk at help@eazycollect.co.uk


    ## Errors


    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure

    of an API call. The error body provided will be either JSON or XML format 

    per the preference included within the headers. Due to the complexity of
    the 

    API and the Direct Debit Scheme, we are unable to provide a definitive list 

    of all the  errors that the system may generate, however we have attempted 

    to make the errors generated as clear as possible – i.e. Plain English. 

    We also recommend using the panels on the right hand side to get aquainted

    with the HTTP status codes the API may return. 


    **Examples:**


    **JSON:**

    ```json

    {
        "Message": "The requested resource does not support http method 'POST'."
    }

    ```


    **XML:**

    ```xml

    <Error>
        <Message>The requested resource does not support http method 'POST'.</Message>
    </Error>

    ```
        
    ## Environments

    We offer two environments to developers, `sandbox` and `ecm3`. Our `sandbox`
    environment is designed

    for all your testing needs. Our `ecm3` environment is our production
    environment and we strongly

    recommend using the `sandbox` environment to get acquainted with how the API
    functions and returns

    data. If you would like access to our `sandbox` environment, please contact
    our sales team at `sales@eazycollect.co.uk`. 


    The two environments behave identically, with the only difference being how
    you would access an environment. All requests to our production environment
    would go through `ecm3.eazycollect.co.uk` whereas requests for our sandbox
    environment would go through `sandbox.eazycollect.co.uk`.


    ## SDKs

    To help improve speed and reliability when integrating into the
    EazyCustomerManager product, we have created open-sourced, MIT licensed SDKs
    for Python, C# and Java for our developers to use. You can view the
    documentation for all three below


    - [Python](https://github.com/EazyCollectServices/EazyCollectSDK-Python)

    - [C#](https://github.com/EazyCollectServices/EazyCollectSDK-Dotnet)

    - [Java](https://github.com/EazyCollectServices/EazyCollectSDK-Java)


    All three SDKs are free to use and no additional setup is required to begin
    using them. All code examples in this document will provide examples based
    on the above SDKs. 


    There are currently no plans to bring the SDKs to additional languages,
    though that may change in the future.

      description: |
        In general, our software will allocate a unique direct debit reference
        for every contract created within the system. For own SUN and FM SUN
        clients that have made prior arrangements with us, it is possible to
        change a reference number after the contract has been set up. Please
        note that using this facility will incur extra charges as new
        instructions will need to be sent to the bank via BACS.

        ### Contract Statuses

        Upon creation, a Contract Status will read ”Inactive” and it will remain
        in this state until approximately 8-9 working days before either (a) the
        start date provided in the create contract call when creating an ad-hoc
        contract call or (b) the first payment date in the case of
        scheduled/recurring payments.

        When in this state, it is inadvisable to attempt to make changes to the
        contract or to push ad-hoc payments to the contract as payments may be
        missed or marked unpaid without an attempt to collect being made.

        We recommend waiting for the contract status to change to “Active”
        (usually 8-9 working days before collection or the start date stated in
        the create contract call) before making changes to the contract or
        pushing payments ad-hoc payments into the system.

        A contract can be manifested in one of two ways:

        | Status | Description

        | ------ | ---------------------------------------------

        | **Active** | The contract is active and will either be producing
        payments if it is a scheduled contract, or able to accept ad-hoc
        payments if it is an ad-hoc contract.

        | **Inactive** | The contract is inactive and cannot produce or accept
        payments, scheduled or otherwise.

        For more information on why a contract may become “Inactive”, the
        `StatusExplaination` field can provide a more detailed explanation. This
        field is free text and we recommend that it is stored and displayed to
        the end user as necessary.

        ### Timeframes

        You should also be aware that you must allow a **minimum** of 10 clear

        working days between setting up a contract and collecting the first

        payment and 5 clear working days between pushing a second or subsequent

        ad-hoc payment and its collection date on an active contract.

        A working day means a banking day in the United Kingdom which is Mondays

        to Fridays and excludes public and bank holidays. A list of public and

        bank holidays can be found here: <https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays>. A

        date checker is also provided on our website:

        <https://www.eazycollect.co.uk/date>.

        While the above timeframes are the minimum required, we strongly

        recommend building yourself a day or two of contingency into your

        processes so that you have time to rectify any problems that may be

        encountered. We are unable *under any circumstances* to accept

        instructions for payments or new contracts after the appropriate cut off

        dates.

      Status:
        description: >
          The status of the payment. This can be:

          - Paid - We have received the payment from the customer (\*\*see
          below)

          - Pending – The payment has been queued to be sent to the bank for
          collection.

          - Represented – The payment has been returned by the bank **unpaid**,
          and the
            system has created a new transaction to try and collect the amount again.
          - Unpaid – The payment has been returned by the bank unpaid and **will
          not**
            be sent again to the bank for collection.
          - Withdrawn – The payment was at the point of being sent to the bank
          for
            collection, but was withdrawn by Access Paysuite at the last minute. The
            payment has not been collected.
          - Indemnity Claimed – The customer has approached their bank for a
          refund
            which is being/has been processed.
          \*\* BACS works by exception; that is to say that payments are assumed
          to be

          paid unless we hear from the bank otherwise. As such, payments remain
          in the

          `Pending` state up until the point they are submitted to the bank for

          collection (3 – 4 working days before the collection date). Upon
          submission,

          the payment status changes to `Paid` although the actual status of the
          payment

          is not known until 1-2 working days after the due date.  Because of
          this, we

          recommend that you do not update your system with the payment status
          until 

          2-3 working days after the Due Date.

          It is also important to note that BACS only works on banking days
          (Monday to

          Friday excluding bank and public holidays). For that reason, if a
          payment

          Due Date is on a weekend or a public holiday, the collection will take
          place

          on the next banking day. For example, a payment due on Saturday, 15th
          April

          2017 will actually collect on Tuesday 18th April 2017 (the Monday
          being Easter

          Monday which is a bank holiday in the UK). Again, this needs to be
          factored in

          to when you check the status of payments; in the above example, it
          would be

          prudent to wait until late in the afternoon of 20th April 2017 or
          better 21st

          April 2017 to ensure that all unpaid messages have been received from
          the bank

          and processed.

      A customer record captures the personal and banking details of the

      person or organisation that you wish to collect funds from. A customer

      record needs to be created before a Direct Debit (contract) record can

      be created to collect payments. There can be multiple Direct Debits

      (contracts) attached to a customer record.

      **Important: You are required to perform a modulus check on bank account
      numbers

      and sort codes before they are passed to the API. We can offer a bank

      checking API on a pay-per-use basis – please contact our Sales

      Department on `01242 650052`for further details on pricing. Failure to

      modulus check data is likely to cause problems in processing your

      payments. **
    name: Customer Manipulation
  - description: |
      A contract record represents the Direct Debit associated with a customer
      record. There are two forms of contract record:
      -   **Ad-hoc:** This is where a Direct Debit is created at the bank for
          the customer, but no payments are requested unless you specifically
          input payments via the Payments or Bulk Payments API call.
      -   **Scheduled:** In this mode, a schedule for payments is stated at
          the outset and the system will create the relevant payments in the
          database approximately five working days before the payments become
          due. Schedules can usually be weekly or monthly, however the
          frequencies available will be communicated to you when the API
          details are provided.
      Customers can have multiple contracts attached to them in order that
      they may have multiple payment streams being collected simultaneously.
    name: Contract Querying and Creation
  - description: |
      Changing the payment amount or date on a scheduled contract can be
      achieved by using one of the following calls. You will need to select
      the correct call for the type of contract that you are amending. For
      example, changing the date on a monthly contract will need a monthly
      call.
      We have only shown the responses from one of the calls as all of the
      calls respond in the same manner. One example of an error is shown,
      however you should be prepared to accept different errors and handle
      them as exceptions during the testing stage.

      It is important to understand that there are two parts to a contract;
      the schedule which creates payments and the Direct Debit which collects
      those payments. By running the following call against the contract, the
      Direct Debit is cancelled which will stop the system from sending
      **scheduled** payments to the bank for collection. They will still be
      created within the system, however they will not be sent to the bank and
      will contribute to customer arrears.
      **NOTE:** This function will **not** affect ad-hoc payments which will
      be sent regardless of the direct debit status. To prevent ad-hoc
      payments from being sent to the bank, they must *be deleted
      individually*.

      Archiving a contract achieves four things:
      - It cancels the direct debit.
      - Writes off any arrears that is outstanding on the contract.
      - Cancels any future scheduled payments (it does not cancel ad-hoc
        payments).
      - Sets the contract status to “archived”.
    name: Archiving a Contract

      Reactivating a Direct Debit takes a contract that is in the cancelled
      state and changes it to “Pending to Activate”. This sends a new
      instruction to the bank to re-set up the direct debit. A “new 0N” charge
      will be made for reactivating a direct debit.

  - description: |
      Restarting a contract is fundamentally different to reactivating a
      contract as it can only be performed if two criteria have been met:
      - The original contract was a fixed term contract which has “Expire”
        as its “atTheEnd” parameter.
      - The payment schedule has come to a natural end **and** the contract
        status has changed to “Expired”.
      This call adds a new contract onto the end of the previous contract, in
      effect “recycling” the previous direct debit at the bank which can save
      on direct debit set up charges.
      This call cannot be used unless both of the two criteria above have been
      met, otherwise unexpected results may occur.
